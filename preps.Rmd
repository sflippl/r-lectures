# Time scale

We should be able to start in week 2. If we do two lectures Ã  two hours a week, we will have established some groundwork by the end of the first term. This time scale critically depends on two factors: 1) to get the lengthy preparations out of the way, 2) find a canonical approach, i. e. tidyverse. 1) specifically applies to contacting DataCamp.

* 2/1: Introduction and philosophy of R
